**Syllabi-Verification-Py-Model: Bloom's Taxonomy and OBE Alignment**

This project, "Syllabi-Verification-Py-Model," is a Python-based application designed to analyze and verify a syllabus. Its primary function is to check if the syllabus's content is aligned with the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy and Outcome-Based Education (OBE).  

**Key Features**
+ Syllabus Content Extraction: The model can extract text from various document formats, including PDFs and images (like PNGs). It uses Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR to accurately process these files. This is a crucial first step, as it converts the syllabus into a format the model can analyze.

+ Bloom's Taxonomy Analysis: The model analyzes the learning objectives and assessments within the syllabus. It identifies keywords and phrases to determine if they correspond to the different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, from "Remember" to "Create"
