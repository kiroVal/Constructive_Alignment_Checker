Higher-order thinking skills (Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating) are less emphasized.\n","* The analysis calculated a 'bloom_score' for each learning outcome based on the highest Bloom's level verb present, ranging from 0 to 5 with a mean of approximately 3.45.\n","* An 'obe_score' was calculated to assess alignment with Outcomes Based Education Standards, considering Bloom's score, presence of keywords in deliverables and assessments, and content availability in all three columns.

Many assessments rely heavily on lower-order thinking skills (recall and comprehension), hindering the development of higher-order thinking skills crucial for a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of suggestions for improvement, categorized by the problematic areas identified:\\n\\n\\n**Overall Pattern: Emphasis on Lower-Order Thinking Skills**\\n\\nThe most significant issue is the over-reliance on lower-order Bloom\\'s Taxonomy levels (0-2).  Many learning outcomes aim for higher-order thinking (analysis, evaluation, creation), but the assessments don\\'t effectively measure these skills.  This needs a fundamental shift in assessment design.\\n\\n\\n**Specific Suggestions by Row:**\\n\\n**0: Describe the course outline...**\\n\\n* **Issue:** While the LinkedIn Learning Certificate is valuable, it doesn\\'t fully assess understanding of course policies and outcomes.  The quiz likely focuses on recall.\\n* **Improvement:** Add a short reflective essay where students connect course policies to their learning experiences and explain how specific course outcomes will be met through their work.\\n\\n**1: Determine the best-fit linear model...**\\n\\n* **Issue:**  \"Coding exercise\" is too broad. It doesn\\'t assess interpretation or contextualization of the model\\'s coefficients.  The OBE score is high, but Bloom\\'s score is low.\\n* **Improvement:**  Require students to write a report interpreting their linear regression model, including a discussion of the limitations of their model and its implications in the context of a specific application. This would promote analysis and evaluation (Bloom\\'s 4 & 5).\\n\\n**2: Create a logistic regression model...**\\n\\n* **Issue:** While better than row 1, the assessment still relies heavily on the coding exercise and a quiz.  The project deliverables are part of the assessment but lack specific criteria for evaluating higher-order skills.\\n* **Improvement:**  Add a component where students present and defend their logistic regression model to the class, addressing potential critiques and explaining their choices in model building.  Develop a detailed rubric for Project Deliverable 1, focusing on the problem statement, research questions, and hypothesized solutions (analysis, evaluation, creation).\\n\\n**4: Explore input data for analysis...**\\n\\n* **Issue:**  In-video quizzes only test knowledge retention, not application or critical thinking.\\n* **Improvement:** Replace in-video quizzes with a project where students analyze a real-world dataset, apply forecasting models, compare their results, and justify their choice of model.  Include a detailed report discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each model used.\\n\\n**5: Describe machine learning...**\\n\\n* **Issue:**  Relies on certificates and in-video quizzes.\\n* **Improvement:** Replace certificates with a project requiring students to choose a real-world problem and apply different machine learning models to solve it.  The assessment should focus on comparing model performance, justifying model selection, and evaluating the results in a written report.\\n\\n**6: Compute and interpret error measures...**\\n\\n* **Issue:** Similar to row 4 and 5, relies too much on in-video quizzes.\\n* **Improvement:**  Ask students to design and analyze a simulation using Agent-Based Modeling to investigate a complex system.  The assessment could focus on the design choices, the interpretation of the simulation results, and a critical evaluation of the model\\'s limitations and potential improvements.\\n\\n**7: Define and explain the SIR Model...**\\n\\n* **Issue:** Coding exercises need more in-depth assessment beyond correctness.\\n* **Improvement:**  Require students to write a report explaining their simulation, including a discussion of the limitations of the SIR model and suggestions for improvement based on their results.\\n\\n**8: Describe queueing theory...**\\n\\n* **Issue:**  The pre-final draft focuses on completion, not analysis or evaluation.\\n* **Improvement:**  The assessment of the pre-final draft should involve peer review focused on the analysis, argumentation, and methodology employed.  The final grade should heavily weigh the quality of analysis and critical thinking demonstrated in this draft and the final project.\\n\\n**9: Give objective feedback...**\\n\\n* **Issue:** Peer review is crucial, but a filled-out form isn\\'t enough.\\n* **Improvement:**  Develop a structured peer review rubric that guides students to provide detailed, constructive feedback on specific aspects of the project, going beyond simple comments.\\n\\n\\n**10: Integrate peer feedback...**\\n\\n* **Issue:**  This is well-aligned, but the overall project needs improvement in higher-order thinking skills.\\n\\n\\n**General Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Rubrics:** Develop detailed rubrics for all assessments, clearly outlining the criteria for each Bloom\\'s Taxonomy level being assessed.\\n* **Higher-Order Thinking Assessments:** Incorporate projects, case studies, presentations, and debates to promote analysis, evaluation, and creation.\\n* **Reflective Assignments:** Add reflective assignments where students articulate their learning process and connect their work to broader concepts.\\n* **Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide timely and constructive feedback on all assessments, helping students improve their understanding and skills.\\n\\n\\nBy implementing these suggestions, the course can effectively shift the focus towards higher-order thinking skills and strengthen the alignment between learning outcomes, deliverables, and assessments, leading to a more engaging and impactful learning experience.\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fb54b351"},"source":["## Save AI suggestions to a text file\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Save the AI-generated suggestions to a text file named `suggestions.txt` in the \"/content/findings\" directory."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5d53bcfd"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","Access the AI-generated suggestions from the `response` object and write the text content to a file named \"suggestions.txt\" inside the \"/content/findings\" directory, creating the directory if it doesn't exist."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"60f2f14f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754529249731,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Genbu","userId":"13985341098998150781"}},"outputId":"9395ff1f-f5f1-4d61-cf27-941531452de2"},"source":["import os\n","\n","# Define the output directory and file path\n","output_dir = '/content/findings'\n","suggestions_txt_path = os.path.join(output_dir, 'suggestions.txt')\n","\n","# Create the output directory if it doesn't exist\n","os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","# Check if the 'response' object and its 'text' attribute are available\n","if 'response' in locals() and hasattr(response, 'text'):\n","    suggestions_text = response.text\n","\n","    # Save the suggestions to a text file\n","    with open(suggestions_txt_path, 'w') as f:\n","        f.write(suggestions_text)\n","\n","    display(f\"AI suggestions saved to '{suggestions_txt_path}'.\")\n","else:\n","    display(\"Error: AI suggestions not found.
